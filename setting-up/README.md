# Setting Up

In this section, you can find how to set up the bot on your server and how to use its commands. There will also be links to more in-depth guides related to the bot.

## Adding G4M3R Bot to your Server.

To add the bot, you must have the '_**Manage Server**_' permission in the server you would like to add it to, and then you can add the bot through the official G4M3R website \( [g4m3r.xyz](https://www.g4m3r.xyz/) \).

**Please give the bot as many permissions as possible.** Otherwise some commands may not function due to missing permissions.

## Changing the Prefix

The default prefix for G4M3R bot is `g!`  
The prefix can be changed in the settings menu using `g!settings`

For a more in-depth explanation, visit the [prefix](prefix.md) page.

## Further Setting Up

You have now successfully added the bot to your server and used a command! You can further adjust the bot to fit your server.  
We recommend you start with the `g!settings` menu. For example you can add other admins and moderators to the bot.

For more information about the commands related to administrating, visit the [admin](../commands/admin/) page.

_**Tip:** Create a bot commands channel in your server and use that for all commands and to try out so you dont flood your general chat._
